Second, the house on the cliff in Kingsport whispered her true name - the name she chose for herself - late at night: \"Stella.\" Delivering the mail six days a week in all kinds of weather wasn't an easy job, but Stella loved knowing that she was helping people connect with one another. Then she started finding the letters. At the end of her route, there was always one extra envelope in her bag. It was always addressed to her. It was always postmarked from Kingsport. And it always contained a letter with one typed word: Stella.\"",
