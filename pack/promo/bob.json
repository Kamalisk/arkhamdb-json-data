        "back_flavor": "For Dexter Drake, the magic of fairy tales and myth has been a lifelong fascination. The chance discovery of an old book page during the Great War opened Drake's eyes to the possibility that magic might truly exist. Years later, the promise of arcane tomes locked away in Miskatonic University's special collection draws the successful stage magician to the quiet town of Arkham. Lured to an auction of occult items, \"Drake the Great\" and his assistant, Molly Maxwell, find themselves targeted by the depraved servants of an otherwordly force of disease and corruption. To save Molly, Arkham, and perhaps the world from a horrific transformation, Drake needs more than his wits and quick hands. He must turn to real magic, even if it risks his mind, body, and spirit.",
