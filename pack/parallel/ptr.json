He told her that He had chosen her from among all the people of the world to be His agent. She would protect the innocent and punish the wicked. Since then, He comes to her in times of trouble, offering guidance and comfort. Zoey now travels from city to city, taking work as a chef to support herself. When she isn’t working, she stalks the night, guided by the Lord’s voice. Wherever she finds wickedness, she strikes it down without remorse or hesitation.",
