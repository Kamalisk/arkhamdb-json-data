The man who had stalked you throughout the city was dedicated in his conviction, as was Herman, the undertaker of the graveyard. Others seemed to have been coerced to aid the cult. Ruth, the mortician, had been told that her family would be killed if she did not supply the ghouls with fresh corpses. Thankfully, you managed to help her escape the hospital safely. Peter, the professor, had to be convinced that his involvement with the cult would do more harm than good. Victoria's obsession with occult artifacts had landed her deep within the cult's web. When you confronted Drew in the asylum, he attacked you — but interestingly, he did so because he thought you were part of the cult. The deeper you delve into this conspiracy, the clearer it becomes that many lives have been ruined by it.",
